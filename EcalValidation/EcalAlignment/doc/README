1) create reconstruction with 0 alignment

    crab -create -cfg crab_validation_simpleNtpleDATA_WZ_NoAlign.cfg
    crab -create -cfg crab_validation_simpleNtpleDATA_WZ_Filter_NoAlign.cfg

That will store data (ROOT trees with electrons) on Castor

2) get the list of the trees to be used for alignment:
   
   rfdir /castor/cern.ch/user/a/amassiro/EcalAlignment/Filter_RAWRECO_NoAlign | awk '{print "@rfio:/castor/cern.ch/user/a/amassiro/EcalAlignment/Filter_RAWRECO_NoAlign/"$9"@,"}' | tr "@" "'" &> text.txt

   rfdir /castor/cern.ch/user/a/amassiro/EcalAlignment/WZEG_RAWRECO_NoAlign | awk '{print "@rfio:/castor/cern.ch/user/a/amassiro/EcalAlignment/WZEG_RAWRECO_NoAlign/"$9"@,"}' | tr "@" "'" &> text.txt
   
and copy in the file "Align_cfg.py"

Or copy the ROOT files in local and hadd them
   rfcpCastor /castor/cern.ch/user/a/amassiro/EcalAlignment/Filter_RAWRECO_NoAlign /tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignment/
   rfcpCastor /castor/cern.ch/user/a/amassiro/EcalAlignment/WZEG_RAWRECO_NoAlign /tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignment/
   
   hadd /tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignment/EcalAlignmentJoin.root /tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignment/EcalAlignment_*


3) Do Alignment:
     EE_Alignment_RotoTraslation AlignEE_cfg.py
     EB_Alignment_RotoTraslation AlignEB_cfg.py
  NB: remember to modify output "txt" file in "Align_cfg.py" to deal with EE and EB 
      (or to use "AlignEE_cfg.py" and "AlignEB_cfg.py"
  Time ~ 3 minutes (it depends on the number of electrons)

  In "Align_cfg.py" enable/disable rotations and traslations
 
4) create new local DB with new alignment constants
  check the consistence of output name in "Align_cfg.py" and input name in "EcalTrivialAlignment_cfi.py"
  (remember absolute path for "EBAlignmentFile", "EEAlignmentFile", "ESAlignmentFile" as in the example)
    cmsRun copyFileAlignEB_cfg.py 
    cmsRun copyFileAlignEE_cfg.py 
   
  to inspect DB do
    sqlite3 EBAlign_2010.db
    .tables
    select *from ALIGNME_M_ALIGN;
    .q

5) run Re-Reco with new DB
    crab -create -cfg crab_validation_simpleNtpleDATA_WZ_MyAlign.cfg
    crab -create -cfg crab_validation_simpleNtpleDATA_WZ_Filter_MyAlign.cfg

6) sanity check
   copy in local

       rfcpCastor /castor/cern.ch/user/a/amassiro/EcalAlignment/Filter_RAWRECO_MyAlign /tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignmentMyAlign/
       rfcpCastor /castor/cern.ch/user/a/amassiro/EcalAlignment/WZEG_RAWRECO_MyAlign /tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignmentMyAlign/
       hadd /tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignmentMyAlign/EcalAlignmentJoinMyAlign.root /tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignmentMyAlign/EcalAlignment_*

   and test EB and EE

       r00t Alignment_Validation_EB.cxx\(\"/tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignment/EcalAlignmentJoin.root\",\"/tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignmentMyAlign/EcalAlignmentJoinMyAlign.root\"\)

       r00t Alignment_Validation_EE.cxx\(\"/tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignment/EcalAlignmentJoin.root\",\"/tmp/amassiro/EcalAlignmentMyAlign/EcalAlignmentJoinMyAlign.root\"\)
