# section for multicrab: now has just the template crab.cfg, but more
# keys might appear in the future
[MULTICRAB]
cfg = crab_NT_MC.cfg

# Section in common for all dataset
# General idea: you define all the parameter in the template (crab.cfg), 
# but you might want to change the template values for all dataset.
# The general syntax is that you first put the crab.cfg [SECTION] and
# the the crab.cfg [key], with a "." in between, exactly as you would do
# to pass to CRAB keys via command line.
# Any parameters can be set or changed
[COMMON]
#EDG.se_black_list=es

##Use only when launching from hercules and you are delivering to storm
# USER.user_remote_dir = /users/ldimatt/PHD_MiBi/TTbar/Spring10_7TeV

# Add a section for each dataset you want to access (or, more precisely,
# any task you want to create).
# The name of the section will be used as USER.ui_working_dir, so the
# stuff for this dataset will be found in Wmunu/ directory.
# Any name is allowed (but MULTICRAB and COMMON) and any number of
# sections can be added
# The syntax for the parameters is the one described before
# SECTION.key=value
# and any parameter can be changed. Otherwise, the template one will be
# used.
